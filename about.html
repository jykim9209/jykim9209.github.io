    I am a Final Year UG student at HKUST, majoring in Computer Engineering. 
    Currently, I am leading the project titled "Real-time People Counting Application at HKUST" that provides 
    the convenience to the students, staff and visitors on the campus by allowing them to check the crowdedness 
    of bus stations and computer rooms. Please visit <a href="http://52.220.34.115/">here</a> to see.<br>

        I would like to use this github blog as a recording place what I read. Mainly, the blog will review the research papers focusing on:
        <ul>
            <li>Area - deep learning; computer vision; multi-modal learning;</li>
        </ul>
